## 3) zhuyansen/wx-favorites-report

- Upstream: https://github.com/zhuyansen/wx-favorites-report
- Author: zhuyansen
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`xc-wechat-local-vault`):
  - Frida hook method for intercepting `CCKeyDerivationPBKDF` (Apple CommonCrypto PBKDF2) to extract SQLCipher encryption keys at runtime
  - SQLCipher 4 page-level decryption logic (AES-256-CBC, page_size=4096, reserve=80)
  - The approach of codesign-bypass to remove Hardened Runtime for frida injection
- What was adapted:
  - The frida JS hook script structure was adapted from the original project's key extraction methodology
  - The database decryption function was implemented based on the documented decryption parameters
  - The overall workflow (codesign → frida spawn → hook → capture keys → match to DB files) follows the same approach

## 4) wechat-article/wechat-article-exporter

- Upstream: https://github.com/wechat-article/wechat-article-exporter
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter`):
  - Referenced workflow for WeChat Official Account search, history sync, multi-format export, and enhanced metric/comment export.
  - The skill points users to their own local or hosted `wechat-article-exporter` instance instead of vendoring upstream code.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - The public skill only includes local wrapper scripts, runbooks, output schemas, safety gates, and attribution links.

## 5) wechat-article/wxdown-service

- Upstream: https://github.com/wechat-article/wxdown-service
- Documentation: https://docs.mptext.top/advanced/wxdown-service
- License: MIT, according to the upstream documentation footer.
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter`):
  - Referenced the credential-capture workflow needed for read counts, likes, shares, comments, and replies.
  - The skill requires explicit user confirmation before any certificate, proxy, credential, or WeChat desktop step.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - `start_wxdown_service.py` only starts a user-provided local checkout path and does not modify system proxy settings.

## 6) sudoHG/codex-grok-search

- Upstream: https://github.com/sudoHG/codex-grok-search
- License: MIT
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-grok-consult`):
  - Referenced the public architecture of invoking the official Grok Build CLI from Codex in an isolated non-Git workspace.
  - Reinforced the boundary that Grok should receive search tools without access to the user's current repository, browser cookies, local shell, or unrelated credentials.
- What was copied:
  - No upstream source code is vendored in this repository.
  - The MCP server, transcript verification, URL extraction, Snowflake timestamp decoder, and Codex plugin packaging are independently implemented here.

## 7) xAI Grok Build CLI

- Official documentation: https://docs.x.ai/build/overview
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-grok-consult`): external runtime dependency for native `x_search`, `web_search`, and `web_fetch`.
- What is included:
  - No Grok Build binary, xAI credential, authentication file, or xAI source code is included.
  - Users install and authenticate the CLI separately under xAI's current terms and documentation.

## 8) afar1/fieldtheory-cli

- Upstream: https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli
- License: MIT
- Local license copy: `licenses/afar1-fieldtheory-cli-LICENSE.txt`
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-bookmarks-export`):
  - Optional external runtime for syncing X bookmarks and reading the user's local Field Theory index through `ft list --json`.
  - The Skill requires a compatible build whose version contains `graphql-only` before it will export X links.
- What was copied:
  - No Field Theory source code, binary, private Query ID, Cookie, credential, or bookmark data is vendored in this repository.
  - `export_x_links.py` is an independently implemented URL-only adapter that invokes the separately installed `ft` command.
- Modification status:
  - `graphql-only` identifies a user-maintained compatibility and safety overlay, not an official upstream Field Theory release name.
  - The modified runtime is not distributed in this repository.
  - Any redistribution of a modified Field Theory build must preserve the upstream MIT copyright and license notice and must not be represented as an official upstream release.

## 9) WeComTeam/wecom-cli

- Upstream: https://github.com/WecomTeam/wecom-cli
- Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wecom/cli
- License: MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 WeCom
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-wecom-operations`):
  - External runtime for owner-authorized document, todo, meeting, schedule, and contact operations.
  - The public Skill invokes a separately installed `wecom-cli`; it does not vendor upstream source or binaries.
- Local-image boundary:
  - The public Skill can use an optional external helper exposing `doc +doc_upload_image` when the user explicitly configures `WECOM_UPLOAD_HELPER`.
  - That helper capability comes from a local, unpublished extension and is not distributed by this repository or represented as an official upstream feature.

## 10) KKKKhazix/khazix-skills (`hv-analysis`)

- Upstream: https://github.com/KKKKhazix/khazix-skills
- Upstream component: https://github.com/KKKKhazix/khazix-skills/tree/7a5c4934be4106ac740ffdb95280bb81b3f4b83c/hv-analysis
- Author: 数字生命卡兹克

- License: MIT
- Local copy of license: `licenses/KKKKhazix-khazix-skills-LICENSE.txt`
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-web-research`):
  - The horizontal-and-vertical research mode is based on, inspired by, and extends the upstream `hv-analysis` Skill.
  - It adopts the core idea of combining longitudinal development with a cross-sectional current-state comparison for entities and industries.
- Local extensions:
  - A canonical research brief and plan, bounded workstreams and localized query groups, claim-source ledgers, source-independence and temporal rules, scope and contradiction gates, retained-gap disclosure, cross-axis evidence chains, and bounded scenarios.
  - Explicit routing boundaries between public search, original-source verification, optional archive, private bookmark export, and ASR.
- What is included:
  - The protocol and implementation in this repository have been adapted for this Skill family and are not represented as an official upstream release.
  - The upstream copyright and complete MIT license text are preserved in the local license copy above.

## 11) joeseesun/yt-search-download

- Upstream: https://github.com/joeseesun/yt-search-download
- Author and copyright: Copyright (c) 2026 Joe Sun (@joeseesun)
- License: MIT
- Local copy of complete license: `licenses/joeseesun-yt-search-download-LICENSE.txt`
- Usage in this repo (`yichen-unified-search`):
  - The public YouTube keyword/channel search and result-filtering behavior in `scripts/youtube_search.py` is derived in part from the upstream project.
  - The local adapter emits normalized discovery candidates and can use a separately configured YouTube Data API credential or a public `yt-dlp` listing fallback.
- Local boundaries:
  - The adapter does not include the upstream download, subtitle, audio-extraction, or media-processing workflow.
  - It does not download media, browser cookies, API credentials, or upstream runtime files into this repository.
  - The adapted implementation remains subject to the upstream MIT copyright and permission notice, while this repository's original contributions remain subject to the repository's own license.

## 12) Zhihu Open Platform CLI-compatible runtime

- Dependency type: separately installed external precompiled runtime used by `yichen-unified-search/scripts/zhihu_adapter.py`.
- What is included:
  - No Zhihu CLI source code, binary, credential, authentication store, or private-account data is distributed in this repository.
  - The local adapter exposes only bounded public search and explicit hot-list discovery surfaces.
- Provenance, license, and terms:
  - This repository does not independently verify that the configured external runtime is an official Zhihu distribution.
  - Users must identify the runtime's distributor and check its applicable license, service terms, redistribution rights, and version-specific notices before installation or use.
  - This repository's license and this notice are not a license grant for the external CLI.

## Notes

- This repository maintains its own license (`LICENSE`) for original contributions. It is personal-learning and non-commercial only.
- The upstream projects listed above retain their original licenses and copyrights.
- Upstream licenses and notices should be preserved when redistributing derived works.
- `xc-wechat-local-vault` is an independent implementation that adapts specific technical approaches from `wx-favorites-report`. It does not contain any code directly copied from the upstream project.
- `yichen-wechat-mp-batch-exporter` references workflows from `wechat-article-exporter` and `wxdown-service`, but does not include their source code, credentials, cached browser data, or downloaded article archives.
- `yichen-x-article-draft-uploader` references workflow and Markdown parsing ideas from `wshuyi/x-article-publisher-skill`; it stores no real credentials in source control and writes exported X cookies only to a private local file with restricted permissions.
- The broader skill packaging conventions reference public Claude skill community practices, including JimLiu/baoyu-skills.
- `yichen-grok-consult` references the public isolation pattern from `sudoHG/codex-grok-search`, but includes an independently implemented MCP server and deterministic verification layer.
- `yichen-bookmarks-export` calls Field Theory as an optional external runtime; Field Theory remains under its upstream MIT License, while this repository's independently implemented adapter remains under this repository's license.
- The horizontal-and-vertical research mode in `yichen-web-research` is based on, inspired by, and extends KKKKhazix/khazix-skills `hv-analysis`; the upstream author, pinned commit, and MIT license are preserved above.
- The YouTube search/filter implementation in `yichen-unified-search` is derived in part from `joeseesun/yt-search-download`; Joe Sun's copyright and the complete MIT license text are preserved above and in the local license copy.
- The Zhihu CLI-compatible runtime is an external dependency and is not redistributed by this repository; users must verify its provenance, license, and service terms separately.
- `yichen-mac-wechat-dual-open` references public X/Twitter discussion and implements the copy + bundle-id + ad-hoc signing workflow locally.
- Do not remove this file when forking for personal study. It is the attribution record for borrowed ideas, workflows, and license notices.
